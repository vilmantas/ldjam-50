### Description:

After stumbling into an ancient cemetery you've found yourself surrounded by walking corpses. 

All they want is to get a hold of that sweet, sweet brain of yours. Is that so much to ask?

You can only stay inside and hope that the fortifications on the shelter (that you just so happen to stumble across) will hold against the unending onslaughts of the dead.

They will not stop. They will make you join them.

The dead come in waves (and at very specific intervals, weird, huh?). After each wave you get some breathing room to walk around and, who knows, maybe gather some supplies to help you survive?

-----

### Game instructions:

Timer at the top displays the amount of time you have for ***gathering supplies*** comes or before ***zombies get smitten by God***.

Zombies spawn at different locations and move towards the ***shelter***. Once their destination is reached they begin chipping away at the ***armor***.

When the zombies are coming the player automatically retreats to the ***shelter***. No further actions can be made while zombies are present.

If armor reaches zero - you're done.

After the zombies die player is free to move again and continue to ***delay the inevitable***

Scattered around the map are ***crates*** that can be ***opened*** for a random amount of supplies (1-4 planks). Bring the ***planks*** back to the ***shelter*** to fix it up or to ***add fortifications***

***Lightning*** will sometimes strike random zombies during the onslaught phase. Don't rely on it to save you though.
